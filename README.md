# Super Tic-Tac-Toe

## Overview

Super Tic-Tac-Toe is an innovative twist on the classic game, featuring a 9x9 board made up of nine 3x3 grids. Players can challenge a bot powered by a minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning or compete against a friend. Strategically win individual grids while controlling the larger board for an engaging gaming experience.

## How to Play

1. **Game Setup**: Players can choose their symbols ('X' or 'O') and decide whether to play against another player or the bot.
2. **Grid Mechanics**: Each 3x3 section acts as an independent tic-tac-toe game. When a player wins a 3x3 grid, their symbol is placed in that grid's position on the larger 9x9 board.
3. **Winning the Game**: The overall winner is determined by forming a line of three winning grids either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally on the 9x9 board.
